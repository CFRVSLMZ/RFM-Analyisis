# RFM-Analyisis

📊 RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) is a marketing technique used to understand customer behavior and segment them more accurately. These three criteria allow us to assess customer value and behavior:

🔄 Recency: When did the customer last make a purchase? This indicates how active the customer is.

📅 Frequency: How often does the customer make purchases? This shows how engaged the customer is with the company.

💰 Monetary: How much money has the customer spent? This reflects the revenue the customer brings to the company.

🛍️ Our Segments:
✨ Best Customers: We offer them exclusive rewards and discounts.
🎁 Loyal Customers: We plan special discounts and new product promotions for them.
🔝 High-Value Customers: We send cross-selling offers to increase their purchases.
🚨 At-Risk Customers: We present special discounts and satisfaction surveys to win them back.
📉 Other Customers: We also pay attention to them with general discount campaigns.

By applying the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model, we can create customer segmentation. This method helps us better understand our customers and prepare tailored campaigns for them.
